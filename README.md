# RealDialog

Attention all Linux `tkinter` coders! Ever cursed `tkinter`'s file dialog? Ever wondered why it doesn't have a search feature, why its list is so hard to scroll in, why it doesn't have your bookmarks and home directories, and why it doesn't have suggestions while you're typing a path? Why doesn't it compete with the native dialogs from your favorite Linux distro?

RealDialog is for you. It's still under development, but it aims to bring you all the features for your `tkinter` file dialogs that Gtk and PyQt apps let you enjoy, but still with `tkinter.ttk`'s coding simplicity and theme customization.

## Goals

Here are the goals RealDialog is trying to reach over the next few months:

- [X] File search
- [ ] File search suggestions
- [ ] Browsing history
- [ ] Keyboard path entry
- [ ] Install from `pip`
- [ ] Create new directories
- [ ] Bookmarks and home directories
- [ ] Right-click menu

Please feel free to submit an issue if you have any more feature requests!
